# Employee Directory
An employee directory with React, requiring my code to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. By clicking on the categories at the top of the table, users can toggle sorting by ascending and descnding of that category, and using an input box, users can filter the directory by first name.

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees renders. The user can sort the table by at least one category (all of them), and can filter the users by at least one property (the first name). Now get to organizing those users!
